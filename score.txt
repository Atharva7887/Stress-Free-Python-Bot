Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a ###### named Bruno. Bruno was not an ordinary ######; he was known for his stubborn yet kind nature. 

Every morning, the farmer would take the ###### to the fields, where he helped carry loads of hay and vegetables. The ###### worked hard, but he also loved to take breaks whenever he pleased. "Bruno, you lazy ######!" the farmer would shout. But Bruno didn’t mind—he simply flicked his tail and continued chewing on a piece of grass.

One day, a traveler passed by the village and saw the ###### standing under a tree. "What a fine ######!" he said. "I wish I had a ###### like this one to carry my bags on my journey."

Bruno, hearing this, brayed loudly as if to say, "I choose my own path, traveler!" The villagers laughed. "That’s Bruno for you, the most independent ###### in the land!"

And so, the ###### continued to live happily in the village, enjoying his days in the sun.
